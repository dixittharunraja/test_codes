Overview:

This repository serves as a centralized collection of test codes designed to verify the full functionality of various devices and components in a single execution. Instead of running multiple individual tests, these consolidated test scripts allow users to quickly diagnose hardware and software functionality in one go.

Purpose:

To ensure all connected components function as expected before deployment.

To simplify troubleshooting by running a single test script instead of multiple isolated tests.

To maintain a well-documented and structured approach for future testing and debugging.


Features:

All-in-One Test Code: A single script that checks the full device functionality.

Modular & Expandable: Easily extendable to include new components or subsystems.

Hardware Compatibility: Supports various microcontrollers and peripherals.

Logs & Debugging: Outputs detailed logs for easy debugging.


Supported Components (Examples)

(Update based on actual devices you are testing)

Microcontrollers (Arduino, STM32, ESP, etc.)

Sensors (Temperature, IMU, IR, etc.)

Displays (OLED, LCD, etc.)

Motors & Drivers

Communication Interfaces (I2C, SPI, UART)


How to Use:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/test-codes-all-in-one.git


2. Open the project in Arduino IDE / PlatformIO / STM32CubeIDE (whichever is relevant).


3. Upload the test script to your microcontroller.


4. View serial output for real-time debugging and test results.
